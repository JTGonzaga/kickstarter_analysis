# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Analyzing Kickstarter trends to determine the best ways to encourage success in crowd funded projects
### Analysis and Challenges
  Working on this project has taught me a lot. Learing the capabilities of excel and getting job applicable experience with it has revealed to me what a useful tool it can be. I was relatively unfamiliar with the capabilites of Excel prior to this, I had always thought it was an inconvienent way to put information into a grid instead of a more familiar document like Word or Google Docs. Getting hands on experience and learning more about what the program can offer has changed my view of Excel entirely. Learning new things always comes with its challenges. The course was able to make things very digestable so I didn't have too many issues as far as following the instructions and being able to apply it. My biggest problem I had with the project was when I accidentally deleted the original Kickstarter worksheet after working on it for a few hours straight, of course I had never saved it so pulling up a previous version was not an option. I ended up downloading another copy of the zip file and inserting another Kickstarter sheet and rewriting the formulas that refrenced it within the databook. At least I didn't end up having to redo everything. I also had some troubles arranging charts correctly at first but, as far as I understand, I was able to complete them correctly.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
  Compiling successful and unsuccessful campaigns using a pivot table allowed me to dive deeper in to ways that launch dates can impact the probability of a successful campaign. Through the data provided, I was able to recognize that the months that had the most successful theater campaigns was May and June, with 111 and 100 successes respectively. The month with the lowest successful campaigns was December with only 37. These results can be from a number of reasons, but what makes the most sense to me is that December is the lowest because people are generally less willing to donate because of holiday spending. As for the more successful months, I theorize that this is a result of the end of tax season and the beginning of summer. Tax refunds means more people have money that they are more willing to part with to donate. The seasonal shift from spring to summer could also indicate that people could be in better moods because of the nice weather which could impact their generosity. Looking at the number of successful campaigns by month, we can also see that every month experienced more successes than failures which means that if you have a good play the odds of having a successful campaign are statistically better than having an unsuccessful one.
