# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Analyzing Kickstarter trends to determine the best ways to encourage success in crowdfunded projects
### Analysis and Challenges
  Working on this project has taught me a lot. Learning the capabilities of Excel and getting job applicable experience with it has revealed to me what a useful tool it can be. I was relatively unfamiliar with the capabilities of Excel prior to this, I had always thought it was an inconvenient way to put information into a grid instead of a more familiar document like Word or Google Docs. Getting hands-on experience and learning more about what the program can offer has changed my view of Excel entirely. Learning new things always comes with its challenges. The course was able to make things very digestible so I didn't have too many issues as far as following the instructions and being able to apply them. The biggest problem I had with the project was when I accidentally deleted the original Kickstarter worksheet after working on it for a few hours straight. Of course, I had never saved it so pulling up a previous version was not an option. I ended up downloading another copy of the zip file and inserting another Kickstarter sheet and rewriting the formulas that referenced it within the databook. At least I didn't end up having to redo everything. I also had some troubles arranging charts correctly at first but, as far as I understand, I was able to complete them correctly. The scenario for this project as a whole was to be able to determine the best pathway to success for Louise, a playwriter, who was seeking consultation for a Kickstarter campaign. Utilizing Excel we are able to provide helpful insight to Louise to encourage the best possible outcome for her.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
  Compiling successful and unsuccessful campaigns using a pivot table allowed me to dive deeper into ways that launch dates can impact the probability of a successful campaign. Through the data represented by the chart below, I was able to recognize that the months that had the most successful theater campaigns were May and June, with 111 and 100 successes respectively. The month with the lowest successful campaigns was December with only 37. These results can be from a number of reasons, but what makes the most sense to me is that December is the lowest because people are generally less willing to donate because of holiday spending. As for the more successful months, I theorize that this is a result of the end of tax season and the beginning of summer. Tax refunds mean more people have money that they are more willing to part with to donate. The seasonal shift from spring to summer could also indicate that people could be in better moods because of the nice weather which could impact their generosity. Looking at the number of successful campaigns by month, we can also see that every month experienced more successes than failures which means that if you have a good play the odds of having a successful campaign are statistically better than having an unsuccessful one.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
  Taking a look at the funding goals of all the campaigns provides us with more insight towards knowing what goal will increase the likelihood of a successful campaign. Looking at the chart below will display trends based on how much a campaign was asking for. Looking at the chart, we can see that Kickstarter campaigns with goals of under $1,000 have the lowest success rate of around 14.5%. Surprisingly to me, it appears that campaigns with goals between $45,000 and $49,999 have the highest success rate of the data collected at around 94%. I thought this was interesting because, if we look at probability, the low and high ends of a dataset tend to be similar in outcomes. I suppose this result happened because about half of the projects analyzed in the dataset are campaigns asking for $50,000 or more. Even though this may be the case, I think this chart would still be useful to show to a potential client as more of a guideline and less of a rule. Especially considering that the client in this situation looking for $10,000 which is at the lower end of the range as a whole. Another thing that stood out to me was the general similarity in all projects ranging from projects asking for $10,000 all the way up to $39,999. I would typically think that asking for more money would result in a lower likelihood of success, but in this dataset that does not appear to be true (at least up to $50,000). Something that I also found interesting was that campaigns over $1,000 to $49,999 all have success rates over 76%. Although this gives more insight on successful campaigns based on goals I theorize that if a goal is higher, the campaign will more than likely last longer than one with a smaller goal.

 ### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
  Personally, I felt that the most challenging part of this module was the analysis. It's easy to arrange data to be more digestible, but looking at lines on a chart or numbers in a document won't necessarily tell you a lot if you don't know exactly what you're looking for. Being able to understand what information you are trying to pull from in a specific dataset and make it more obvious for someone who is, simply, taking a glance at it is harder than I initially thought. Especially considering how much data can be forced to look a way that confirms a specific narrative through confirmation bias, I felt a personal duty to make my information as transparent as possible. A general difficulty I had was that it was easy for me to look at something and understand what I needed to do, but I didn't necessarily take the time to think about why I needed to do it until I reached the module challenge. Seeing myself do that made me take a step back and reassess why I enrolled in this boot camp. Of course, it's easy to get work done just for the sake of getting work done, but being able to understand how doing something in this class can be put to use in a career is ultimately the most important thing I can take from this experience. Not only that, but I feel like I personally learn quicker and retain knowledge better when I know why something works instead of just making it work. Since this will most likely be one of the easier modules in this boot camp, I'm glad that I came to this forced conclusion with this project as I feel that I can look at future modules more closely and get the most out of it.
## Results
- A conclusion I can draw about the outcomes based on launch date is that most successful theater campaigns launched in the months of May and June. Another one I can determine is that the month with the lowest successful theater campaigns was December. Utilizing this data, I would suggest that a theater campaign should launch in the months of May and June based on past trends.
- Analyzing outcomes based on goals, I can conclude that there are a large number of unsuccessful campaigns with goals under $1,000. Another thing I noticed was that campaigns from $5,000 to $39,999 were all within a 4% success rate of each other. The funding range between $45,000 and $49,999 had the highest successful campaign percentage of around 94%. 
- A limitation of this dataset is that this doesn't include any information about outside factors that contribute to the success of a campaign such as advertising, quality of product, quality of advertisement, completed projects, etc. All of these things can dramatically impact a funding campaign and can't necessarily be measured in a dataset. 
- Other possible tables/graphs we could create based on this dataset are Length of Campaign vs Outcome. This would give a little bit more insight on how long someone should expect a funding campaign to take to complete. This would also allow someone to plan how to complete the project better. Another thing that would be interesting to look at is average donation vs category to see what categories of campaigns receive the biggest/smallest donations.
